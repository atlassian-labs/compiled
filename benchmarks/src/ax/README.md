# ax() benchmarks

```
Start ax benchmarking

==>  ax() array x 227,905 ops/sec ±1.35% (89 runs sampled)
==>  ax() single string x 503,885 ops/sec ±0.71% (93 runs sampled)
==>  newAx() array x 245,405 ops/sec ±0.79% (89 runs sampled)
==>  newAx() single string x 551,815 ops/sec ±1.93% (87 runs sampled)

Fastest is newAx() single string
```
