# Installation

Setup is required.
Install the [React](https://reactjs.org) package with `npm` or your package manager of choice.

```bash
npm install @compiled/react
```

Then configure your bundler of choice or use [Babel](https://babeljs.io) directly.

## Webpack

Install the [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) loader.

```bash
npm install @compiled/webpack-loader --save-dev
```

Add the loader to your [Webpack config](https://webpack.js.org/).
Make sure this is defined after other loaders so it runs first.

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|ts|tsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          { loader: 'babel-loader' },
          {
            // ↓↓ defined last ↓↓
            loader: '@compiled/webpack-loader',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

If you're shipping an app you'll also be interested in CSS extraction,
read the [Webpack CSS extraction](/css-extraction-webpack) for a step-by-step guide.

See the [loader package docs](/pkg-webpack-loader) for configuration options.

## Parcel

Install the [Parcel v2](https://v2.parceljs.org) configuration.

```bash
npm install @compiled/parcel-config --save-dev
```

Add the compiled preset to your [Parcel config](https://parceljs.org/features/plugins/).

```json
{
  "extends": ["@parcel/config-default", "@compiled/parcel-config"]
}
```

See the [configuration package docs](/pkg-parcel-config) for configuration options.

## Babel

> **Local development** <br />
> When developing locally its advised to use a bundler instead of Babel directly for improved developer experience.

Install the [Babel](https://babeljs.io) plugin.

```bash
npm install @compiled/babel-plugin --save-dev
```

Add the plugin to your [Babel config](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration).
Make sure this is defined after other plugins so it runs first.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    // ↓↓ defined last ↓↓
    "@compiled/babel-plugin"
  ]
}
```

See the [plugin package docs](/pkg-babel-plugin) for configuration options.
