# @compiled/webpack-loader

import { Lozenge, HorizontalStack } from '@compiled/website-ui';

<HorizontalStack gap={0.5} spacing={2}>
  <Lozenge>Webpack 4</Lozenge>
  <Lozenge>Webpack 5</Lozenge>
</HorizontalStack>

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) loader used to transform your code.
See [installation](/installation#webpack) for setup instructions.

```bash
npm install @compiled/webpack-loader --save-dev
```

## Options

Configure in your Webpack config.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          { loader: 'babel-loader' },
          {
            loader: '@compiled/webpack-loader',
            options: {
              importReact: true,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### importReact: boolean

Will import React into the module if it is not found.
When using `@babel/preset-react` with the [automatic runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#react-automatic-runtime) this is not needed and can be set to `false`.

Defaults to `true`.

### importSources: string[]

Additional libraries that should be parsed as though they were `@compiled/react` imports. This is passed directly to `@compiled/babel-plugin`.

Specifying this is important if you are using Compiled APIs through another package using the `createStrictAPI` function.

### extract: boolean

Enables extracting all styles to an atomic style sheet,
to be used in conjunction with `CompiledExtractPlugin`.
Read the [Webpack CSS extraction](/css-extraction-webpack) guide for help.

Defaults to `false`.

### bake: boolean

Enables baking your styles into JavaScript.

Defaults to `true`.

### optimizeCss: boolean

Will run additional cssnano plugins to normalize CSS during build.

Defaults to `true`.

### addComponentName: boolean

Add the component name as class name to DOM in non-production environment if styled is used.

Default to `false`

### sortAtRules: boolean

Whether to sort at-rules, including media queries.

See [here](/media-queries-and-other-at-rules) for more information.

Defaults to `true`.

### ssr: boolean

To be used in conjunction with `extract: true` when having a different configuration for SSR.
When set will prevent additional require (one import per rule) in the bundle during style sheet extraction.

Defaults to `false`.

### transformerBabelPlugins: PluginItem[]

Babel transformer plugins to be applied to transformed files before the Compiled evaluation.

Use this if you have some sort of babel plugin that should run before Compiled,
likely because you have some sort of non-standard syntax in your code.
See the [babel docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins/#transform-plugins) for more context.

Example usage:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          { loader: 'babel-loader' },
          {
            loader: '@compiled/webpack-loader',
            options: {
              transformerBabelPlugins: [
                [
                  '@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators',
                  {
                    legacy: true,
                  },
                ],
              ],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Defaults to none.

### parserBabelPlugins: ParserPlugin[]

Babel parser plugins to be used when parsing the source code. Define these to enable extra babel parsers (for example, typescript).
See the [babel docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins/#syntax-plugins) for more context.

Example usage:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          { loader: 'babel-loader' },
          {
            loader: '@compiled/webpack-loader',
            options: {
              parserBabelPlugins: ['typescript'],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### extractStylesToDirectory?: \{ source: string; dest: string \};

When set, extracts styles to an external CSS file. Read [babel-plugin-strip-runtime](/pkg-babel-plugin-strip-runtime) for more information.


## CompiledExtractPlugin

Plugin to be used when the `extract` option is set to `true`.

```js
// webpack.config.js
const { CompiledExtractPlugin } = require('@compiled/webpack-loader');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [new CompiledExtractPlugin()],
};
```

### nodeModulesTest: Condition

As a performance optimization you can test paths to include by [passing a webpack condition](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#condition) to the plugin.

```js
new CompiledExtractPlugin({
  nodeModulesTest: /@atlaskit/,
});
```

### nodeModulesInclude: Condition

As a performance optimization you can include paths by [passing a webpack condition](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#condition) to the plugin.

```js
new CompiledExtractPlugin({
  nodeModulesInclude: [require.resolve('@atlaskit/button')],
});
```

### nodeModulesExclude: Condition

As a performance optimization you can exclude paths by [passing a webpack condition](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#condition) to the plugin.

```js
new CompiledExtractPlugin({
  nodeModulesExclude: [require.resolve('@atlaskit/button')],
});
```

### cacheGroupExclude: boolean

To be used in conjunction with `extract: true` when having a different configuration for SSR.
This will prevent the additional `cacheGroup` chunk to be created during style sheet extraction; compiled-css files should be only generated in the client-side.

```js
new CompiledExtractPlugin({
  cacheGroupExclude: true,
});
```
