# @compiled/babel-plugin

import { Lozenge, HorizontalStack } from '@compiled/website-ui';

<HorizontalStack gap={0.5} spacing={2}>
  <Lozenge>Babel 7</Lozenge>
</HorizontalStack>

[Babel plugin](https://babeljs.io) used to bake styles into your JavaScript.
See [installation](/installation#babel) for setup instructions.

```bash
npm install @compiled/babel-plugin --save-dev
```

> **Double transform** <br/> When configuring Babel watch out for inadvertently transforming your code with Compiled twice if _also using one of the bundler packages_.
> Utilizing [JavaScript configuration files](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration#javascript-configuration-files) can help you conditionally set plugins based on your running environment.

## Options

Configure in your Babel config.

```json
// .babelrc
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "@compiled/babel-plugin",
      {
        "importReact": true,
        "cache": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

### importReact: boolean

Will import React into the module if it is not found.
When using `@babel/preset-react` with the [automatic runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#react-automatic-runtime) this is not needed and can be set to `false`.

Defaults to `true`.

### cache: boolean | 'single-pass'

Will cache the result of statically evaluated imports.

- `true` will cache for the duration of the node process
- `'single-pass'` will cache for a single pass of a file
- `false` turns caching off

Defaults to `true`.

### optimizeCss: boolean

Will run additional cssnano plugins to normalize CSS during build.

Defaults to `true`.

### onIncludedFiles: (files: string[]) => void

Will callback at the end of a file pass with all imported files that were statically evaluated into the file.

### addComponentName: boolean

Add the component name as class name to DOM in non-production environment if styled is used.

Default to `false`

### importSources: string[]

Additional libraries that should be parsed as though they were `@compiled/react` imports.

Specifying this is important if you are using Compiled APIs through another package using the `createStrictAPI` function.
