# @compiled/codemods

We provide a few codemods for migrating from styled components and emotion to Compiled. The codemods are implemented with [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift). Compiled codemods are enrolled in the [CodeshiftCommunity](https://www.codeshiftcommunity.com/docs/) tooling for easy usage.

## Codemods

```bash
# Transform single file
npx @codeshift/cli --packages @compiled/codemods /Project/path/to/file

# Transform multiple files
npx @codeshift/cli --packages @compiled/codemods /Project/**/*.tsx
```

Our codemods will transform the source code into code that utilises `@compiled/react`. Keep in mind that the change will happen in-place so make sure you're utilising version control or backup the original source.

### Emotion to Compiled

```bash
# Transform single file
npx @codeshift/cli --packages "@compiled/codemods#emotion-to-compiled" /Project/path/to/file

# Transform multiple files
npx @codeshift/cli --packages "@compiled/codemods#emotion-to-compiled" /Project/**/*.tsx
```

Will convert all usages of Emotion to Compiled.
For code that could not be automatically converted a `/** TODO(@compiled/react codemod):` comment will be placed.

### Styled components to Compiled

```bash
# Transform single file
npx @codeshift/cli --packages "@compiled/codemods#styled-components-inner-ref-to-ref" /Project/path/to/file

# Transform multiple files
npx @codeshift/cli --packages "@compiled/codemods#styled-components-inner-ref-to-ref" /Project/**/*.tsx
```

Will convert all usages of Styled Components to Compiled.
For code that could not be automatically converted a `/** TODO(@compiled/react codemod):` comment will be placed.
