# Composition

Composing styles together will enable you to reuse styles and have more flexibility.

Traditionally when defining CSS it is not the `className` order that ensures style get applied,
but the the [order of CSS rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance) in the DOM.
This is a common cause for developer confusion.

Compiled eliminates these cascade gotchas by ensuring the last CSS property defined always wins.

<CompositionIdentifier />

When composing styles together remember that the last defined style will win.
In this example we can see that red overrides the pink color.

<CompositionMultiple />

Style composition works with all APIs found in Compiled.
Read [more about atomic CSS](/atomic-css#overriding-through-composition) to understand how this works.
