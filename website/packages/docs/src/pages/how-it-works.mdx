# How it Works

Once you've [installed and configured](/installation) everything, you can start using it,
but it's best to explain what happens under the hood.

Compiled uses Babel (with pre-configuration options via Webpack and Parcel) to transform styles
into atomic CSS determined at build time, resulting in **very performant components**.

Let's take a typical component you might write:

```jsx
/** @jsxImportSource @compiled/react */
import { css } from '@compiled/react';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

type Props = { inverted?: boolean, children: ReactNode };

const largeTextStyles = css({
  fontSize: '48px',
  padding: '8px',
  background: '#eee',
});
const invertedStyles = css({
  background: '#333',
  color: '#fff',
});

export const LargeText = ({ inverted, children }: Props): JSX.Element => {
  return <span css={[largeTextStyles, inverted && invertedStyles]}>{children}</span>;
};
```

## Runtime styles (unperformant)

With the most basic Babel setup, Compiled will be transformed to **runtime styles**.
This is typically used in a development or testing environments.

It is **not recommended in production environments** as it will be less performant, but also mixing
runtime and extraction can result in breaking visual changes from atomic specificity conflicts.
Refer to [extracted styles](#extracted-styles) below for the recommendation.

```bash
$ babel src
Successfully compiled 1 file with Babel (9ms)
```

You'll see a few things happening in the code below:

1. All styles are converted into [Atomic CSS](/atomic-css) for reuse.
2. Some styles, such as `padding:8px` will be expanded out to `padding-left`, `padding-right`, etc,
   while others might be sorted. [Read more about this](shorthand)
3. All `css()` calls are replaced with `null` and instead the styles are injected at runtime with the
   `className` inlined. Note that `cssMap()` works slightly differently and maintains the object syntax.
4. There are a few internal runtime functions that are used to manage the styles like `ax` and `CC`.
   [Read more about this](/pkg-react-runtime)
5. [Postcss](https://postcss.org/), [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), and some other
   optimizations will run over your code to make it more performant and safer for use.

```jsx
import { ax, ix, CC, CS } from '@compiled/react/runtime';
const _8 = '._syazu67f{color:#fff}';
const _7 = '._bfhk1d6m{background-color:#333}';
const _6 = '._bfhkr75e{background-color:#eee}';
const _5 = '._19bvftgi{padding-left:1pc}';
const _4 = '._n3tdftgi{padding-bottom:1pc}';
const _3 = '._u5f3ftgi{padding-right:1pc}';
const _2 = '._ca0qftgi{padding-top:1pc}';
const _ = '._1wybckbl{font-size:3pc}';
const largeTextStyles = null;
const invertedStyles = null;
export const LargeText = ({ inverted, children }) => {
  return (
    <CC>
      <CS>{[_, _2, _3, _4, _5, _6, _7, _8]}</CS>
      <span
        className={ax([
          '_1wybckbl _ca0qftgi _u5f3ftgi _n3tdftgi _19bvftgi _bfhkr75e',
          inverted && '_bfhk1d6m _syazu67f',
        ])}>
        {children}
      </span>
    </CC>
  );
};
```

## Extracted styles

We highly suggest you turn on style extraction to distribute styles statically at build time,
either through [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) or Production environments. Doing this, styles will
have their **runtime stripped and styles extracted** to an [atomic style sheet](/atomic-css).

Refer to [stylesheet extraction](/css-extraction-webpack) for more details.

Let's compare this to runtime styles, assuming we have Parcel configured

```bash
$ parcel build ./src/index.html
âœ¨ Built in 4.94s
dist/index.html               246 B    349ms
dist/index.019bae5f.js    136.13 KB    806ms
# This generates `index.compiled.css` file(s) too.
ðŸŒ½ âœ… Done in 6.26s
```

You'll see a few different things are happening in the code below:

1. All styles are moved into a separate file, `index.compiled.css`, that is imported into this file for
   your bundler to pick up and combine and serve to the user.
2. The runtime injection of `<CS>` is no longer required because the styles are statically available.

The main difference beyond the greatly reduced runtime cost is that the atomic styles can be completely deduplicated.

```diff
+import "./index.compiled.css";
-import { ax, ix, CC, CS } from '@compiled/react/runtime';
+import { ax, ix } from "@compiled/react/runtime";
-const _8 = '._syazu67f{color:#fff}';
-const _7 = '._bfhk1d6m{background-color:#333}';
-const _6 = '._bfhkr75e{background-color:#eee}';
-const _5 = '._19bvftgi{padding-left:8px}';
-const _4 = '._n3tdftgi{padding-bottom:8px}';
-const _3 = '._u5f3ftgi{padding-right:8px}';
-const _2 = '._ca0qftgi{padding-top:8px}';
-const _ = '._1wybckbl{font-size:3pc}';
var largeTextStyles = null;
var invertedStyles = null;
export const LargeText = ({ inverted, children }) => {
  return (
-    <CC>
-      <CS>{[_, _2, _3, _4, _5, _6, _7, _8]}</CS>
    <span
      className={ax([
        '_1wybckbl _ca0qftgi _u5f3ftgi _n3tdftgi _19bvftgi _bfhkr75e',
        inverted && '_bfhk1d6m _syazu67f',
      ])}>
      {children}
    </span>
-    </CC>
  );
};
```

For reference, the atomic stylesheet is created just as before, now in `index.compiled.css`, and with
the bundler config, these `*.compiled.css` files will be merged together with duplicates removed, resulting
in a drastically smaller CSS payload to the customer.

These `*.compiled.css` files could be distributed via NPM or collected and bundled to customers.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
._19bvftgi{padding-left:8px}
._1wybckbl{font-size:3pc}
._bfhk1d6m{background-color:#333}
._bfhkr75e{background-color:#eee}
._ca0qftgi{padding-top:8px}
._n3tdftgi{padding-bottom:8px}
._syazu67f{color:#fff}
._u5f3ftgi{padding-right:8px}
```
