# Server Side Rendering

[Server side rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html) (SSR) is an important tool used to show your app faster to your users on the initial page load.

> **Extract styles**<br/>
> When [extracting styles](/css-extraction-webpack) the following information no longer applies.

Have you heard the phrase "SSR is zero config" before?
In the context of Compiled -
consumers of your components don't have to do anything to make it work.
Just import and go!

This is accomplished by inlining `style` elements in the server rendered markup,
like so:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<style data-cmpld=true>._k48pni7l{font-weight:600}</style>
<div class="_k48pni7l">
  <style data-cmpld=true>._syaz18rw{color:#ff5630}</style>
  <div class="_syaz18rw">hello world</div>
</div>
```

And then on the web browser when the JavaScript initializes they get moved to the head of the document:

```html
<div class="_k48pni7l">
  <div class="_syaz18rw">hello world</div>
</div>
```

The magic sauce though -
if any atomic CSS is defined multiple times only the first atomic rule will render,
resulting in less styles rendered initially:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<style data-cmpld=true>._k48pni7l{margin-top:24px}</style>
<div class="_k48pni7l">
  <style data-cmpld=true>._syaz18rw{color:#ff5630}</style>
  <div class="_k48pni7l _syaz18rw">hello world</div>
  <div class="_k48pni7l _syaz18rw">hello world</div>
  <div class="_k48pni7l _syaz18rw">hello world</div>
  <div class="_k48pni7l _syaz18rw">hello world</div>
</div>
```

This strategy of rendering `style` elements next to their pairing component has two main benefits:

1. Consumers of your components don't need to configure anything
1. When using the [React streaming server API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertonodestream) component styles are streamed together with your component markup,
   resulting in content being rendered to users faster

> **Warning** <br /> This will interfere with nth child and similar selectors as it is inserts style tags directly into your markup.
> We have an [RFC where we are thinking about what to do with this](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/31) - please join the conversation!

## Selector workarounds

There are a few workarounds for the nth child type selector problems.
Try to only use these workarounds if you can't think of an alternate implementation,
such as applying styles directly to the element you're interested in.

### First child

Here we target the `:first-child` element.

```jsx
<div css={{
  '& :first-child': {
    color: 'red'
  }
}}>
  <div /> <-- text will be red, after JavaScript executes
  <div />
</div>
```

But the text isn't red before the JavaScript has executed!

To workaround this we can use a different selector,
by using one of the following:
 - `:first-of-type`
 - explicitly marking the first child with a [data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)
 - explicitly excluding the inline `style` elements with `:not(style[data-cmpld])`

```jsx
<div css={{
  '& :first-of-type': {
    color: 'red'
  }
}}>
  <div /> <-- text will be red, always
  <div />
</div>
```

```jsx
<div css={{
  '& [data-first-child]': {
    color: 'red'
  }
}}>
  <div data-first-child /> <-- text will be red, always
  <div />
</div>
```

### Nth child

This also applies to `:nth-child` as well,
where `style` elements can appear and complicate things before JavaScript has executed.

```jsx
<div css={{
  '& :nth-child(even)': {
    color: 'red'
  },
  '& :nth-child(odd)': {
    color: 'blue'
  }
}}>
  <div /> <-- text will be red, after JavaScript executes
  <div /> <-- text will be blue, after JavaScript executes
</div>
```

```jsx
<div css={{
  '& [data-even]': {
    color: 'red'
  },
  '& [data-odd]': {
    color: 'blue'
  }
}}>
  <div data-even /> <-- text will be red, always
  <div data-odd /> <-- text will be blue, always
</div>
```
