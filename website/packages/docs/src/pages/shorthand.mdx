# Shorthand properties

Shorthand properties are properties that are used to set the values of several other properties ("longhand properties"). Examples include the shorthand property `font`, which can be used to set the longhand properties `fontWeight`, `fontStyle`, `fontFamily`, and so on.

We **do not** recommend mixing shorthand properties and longhand properties in the same component, as the precedence of the properties may not be what you expect.

## How does Compiled handle shorthand and longhand properties?

By default, Compiled expands a few common properties, like `margin` and `padding`, but this is complex and not done for all properties.

If shorthand sorting is enabled, then all shorthand properties in Compiled will come before their longhand forms. For example, `font` will come before `fontWeight` and `fontStyle`. The order your CSS properties appear in your source code is **ignored**.

Whether shorthand sorting is enabled depends on whether stylesheet extraction is turned on or not -- see below for more details.

The exact sorting method used differs, depending on whether you have stylesheet extraction enabled or not, i.e. you have set `extract: true` in your Webpack or Parcel configuration. We recommend turning on stylesheet extraction if possible.

Note that there is a bug where [stylesheet extraction cannot be used for Parcel](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/1306) when running in local development. (Production is okay)

## Stylesheet extraction turned on

If stylesheet extraction is turned on, then shorthand property sorting is controlled by the `sortShorthand` option. This is set to `false` by default, meaning that if stylesheet extraction is turned on, shorthand properties will not be sorted in any way by default.

If you are using Webpack, set `sortShorthand: true` as an option like `new CompiledExtractPlugin({ sortShorthand: true })`. If you are using Parcel, set `sortShorthand: true` in your Compiled configuration file (e.g. `.compiledcssrc`), but note that stylesheet extraction won't work unless you are in production mode [due to a bug](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/1306).

With `sortShorthand` set to `true`, shorthand properties will be sorted deterministically, with more specific shorthand properties taking precedence over less specific shorthand properties. Shorthand property sorting takes precedence over the sorting of pseudo-selectors. For example, given the following example:

```tsx
/** @jsxAutomaticRuntime @compiled/react */
import { css } from '@compiled/react';
import React from 'react';

const styles = css({
  border: '4.5px solid blue',
  '&:hover': {
    borderColor: 'pink',
    border: '5px dashed yellow',
  },
  '&:active': {
    border: '3px solid green',
  },
  '@media (max-width: 300px)': {
    border: '7px solid orange',
    borderColor: 'teal',
  },
});

const styles2 = css({
  borderColor: 'pink',
  '&:active': {
    border: '2px solid yellow',
  },
  '@media (max-width: 300px)': {
    border: '9px solid orange',
  },
  '@media (max-width: 500px)': {
    border: '4px solid yellow',
    borderColor: 'pink',
  },
});

export const App = () => (
  <>
    <div css={styles}>hi</div>
    <div css={styles2}>hi</div>
  </>
);
```

The generated CSS stylesheet will look like:

```css
/*
 * At rule sorting
 * (e.g. ensuring @media comes after other styles)
 * takes precedence over shorthand property sorting
 * (e.g. ensuring border comes before border-color),
 * which takes precedence over pseudo-selector sorting
 * (ensuring :hover comes before :active).
*/
._19ityspe {
  border: 4.5px solid blue;
}
._bfw71ye4:hover {
  border: 5px dashed yellow;
}
._n7dwtm4l:active {

}
._n7dw10b9:active {

}
._1h6d32ev {
  border-color: pink;
}
._4cvx32ev:hover {
  border-color: pink;
}
@media (max-width: 300px) {
  ._15bwas8u {
    border: 9px solid orange;
  }
  ._15bw16ui {
    border: 7px solid orange;
  }
  ._r0v71my7 {
    border-color: teal;
  }
}
@media (max-width: 500px) {
  ._3x4x1glk {
    border: 4px solid yellow;
  }
  ._118v32ev {
    border-color: pink;
  }
}
```

## Stylesheet extraction turned off

> We recommend turning on stylesheet extraction to fully gain the de-duplication benefits of atomic CSS.

If stylesheet extraction is turned off, shorthand property sorting becomes a bit more rudimentary.

Similarly to when stylesheet extraction is turned on, shorthand properties here are sorted before longhand properties. However, they are no longer guaranteed to be sorted when they are used in a pseudo-selector (especially when you have more than one component), e.g.

```tsx
/** @jsxAutomaticRuntime @compiled/react */
import { css } from '@compiled/react';
import React from 'react';

const styles = css({
  // Can guarantee that `borderColor: pink` will come after `border: 4px solid yellow`
  border: '4px solid yellow',
  borderColor: 'pink',
  '&:active': {
    // If there are other Compiled components in the app, we
    // CANNOT guarantee that `borderColor: green` will come after `border: 2px solid yellow`
    border: '2px solid yellow',
    borderColor: 'green',
  },
});

export const App = () => (
  <>
    <div css={styles}>hi</div>
  </>
);
```

We recommend that you turn on stylesheet extraction to prevent this. However, note the caveat that in Parcel, when in development mode, [stylesheet extraction will not work unless you switch to production mode](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/1306).
