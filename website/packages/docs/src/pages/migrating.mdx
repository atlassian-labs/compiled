# Migrating to Compiled

Follow the [installation](/installation) instructions before continuing.

## Styled Components

Replace the imports with `@compiled/react`.

```diff
-import styled from 'styled-components';
+import { styled } from '@compiled/react';
```

There exists a [codemod](/pkg-codemods#styled-components-to-compiled) to streamline this.
For features that aren't available due to the compile time nature of the library read [limitations](/limitations).

## Emotion

Replace the imports with `@compiled/react`.

> **Incremental adoption**<br />
> To find every call site to convert install the `no-emotion-css` rule from the [ESLint plugin](/pkg-eslint-plugin).

```diff
/** @jsx jsx */
-import { css, jsx } from '@emotion/core';
+import { css, jsx } from '@compiled/react';
```

```diff
-/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */
+/** @jsxImportSource @compiled/react */
```

```diff
-import styled from '@emotion/styled';
+import { styled } from '@compiled/react';
```

```diff
-import { css, ClassNames, keyframes } from '@emotion/core';
-import { css, ClassNames, keyframes } from '@emotion/react';
+import { css, ClassNames, keyframes } from '@compiled/react';
```
