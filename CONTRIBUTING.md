Atlassian requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement,
known as a CLA.
This serves as a record stating that the contributor is entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation
to the project and is willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works (or is willing to transfer ownership).

Prior to accepting your contributions we ask that you please follow the appropriate link below to digitally sign the CLA.
The Corporate CLA is for those who are contributing as a member of an organization and the individual CLA is for those contributing as an individual.
