### Minor Changes

- 9a15e742: Sort shorthand properties so that they come before longhand properties.

  When using Compiled, one of the following will happen:

  Option 1. If stylesheet extraction is turned off ("runtime mode"): shorthand properties will be sorted before longhand properties, as long as they are not in a pseudo-selector like `:hover` or `:active`. This is enabled by default and cannot be turned off.

  Option 2. If stylesheet extraction is turned on and one of the below is true:

  - You are using Webpack
  - You are using Parcel AND you are running in production mode

  ... shorthand properties will only be sorted if `sortShorthand: true` is passed to `CompiledExtractPlugin` (Webpack), or `sortShorthand: true` is passed to your Compiled config file like `.compiledcssrc` (Parcel). When sorting shorthand properties using this method (option 2), shorthand properties will always be sorted before longhand properties, taking precedence over pseudo-selectors like `:hover` or `:active`.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- a0f8c897: - Set `parserBabelPlugins` to default to `['typescript', 'jsx']`
  - This is already used across different Atlassian codebases.
  - Add missing 'babelrc: false' for all internal `parseAsync` calls to Babel. This was already included for `transformFromAstAsync` calls.

### Patch Changes

- db572d43: - @compiled/babel-plugin-strip-runtime:
  - Fix `css` function calls not being extracted when using classic JSX pragma syntax and `@babel/preset-react` is turned on. Now, when the classic JSX pragma syntax is used for Compiled and `@babel/preset-react` is turned on (assuming `@babel/preset-react` runs before `@compiled/babel-plugin-strip-runtime`), the JSX pragma and the `jsx` import will be completely removed in the output.
  - The previous version of this PR caused a regression where using the classic JSX pragma `/** @jsx jsx */` with Emotion no longer worked; this is now fixed.
  - @compiled/utils: Add JSX pragma regex (as used by `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx`) directly to @compiled/utils
  - @compiled/eslint-plugin: Use the official JSX pragma regex `/^\s*\*?\s*@jsx\s+([^\s]+)\s*$/m` instead of `/@jsx (\w+)/`; the former is used in `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx`
