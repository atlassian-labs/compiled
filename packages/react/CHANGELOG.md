## 0.16.2

### Patch Changes

- be019f11: Add detectConflictWithOtherLibraries and onlyRunIfImportingCompiled config options to jsx-pragma ESLint rule. Both are set to true by default, hence the breaking change.

  `detectConflictWithOtherLibraries` raises a linting error if `css` or `jsx` is imported from `@emotion/react` (or `@emotion/core`) in the same file
  as a Compiled import. Set to true by default.

  `onlyRunIfImportingCompiled` sets this rule to only suggest adding the JSX pragma if the `css` or `cssMap` functions are imported from `@compiled/react`, as opposed to whenever the `css` attribute is detected at all. Set to false by default.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 4caa6784: The xcss prop is now available.
  Declare styles your component takes with all other styles marked as violations
  by the TypeScript compiler. There are two primary use cases for xcss prop:

  - safe style overrides
  - inverting style declarations

  Interverting style declarations is interesting for platform teams as
  it means products only pay for styles they use as they're now the ones who declare
  the styles!

  The `XCSSProp` type has generics which must be defined â€” of which should be what you
  explicitly want to maintain as API. Use `XCSSAllProperties` and `XCSSAllPseudos` types
  to enable all properties and pseudos.

  ```tsx
  import { type XCSSProp } from '@compiled/react';

  interface MyComponentProps {
    // Color is accepted, all other properties / pseudos are considered violations.
    xcss?: XCSSProp<'color', never>;

    // Only backgrond color and hover pseudo is accepted.
    xcss?: XCSSProp<'backgroundColor', '&:hover'>;

    // All properties are accepted, all pseudos are considered violations.
    xcss?: XCSSProp<XCSSAllProperties, never>;

    // All properties are accepted, only the hover pseudo is accepted.
    xcss?: XCSSProp<XCSSAllProperties, '&:hover'>;
  }

  function MyComponent({ xcss }: MyComponentProps) {
    return <div css={{ color: 'var(--ds-text-danger)' }} className={xcss} />;
  }
  ```

  The xcss prop works with static inline objects and the [cssMap](https://compiledcssinjs.com/docs/api-cssmap) API.

  ```tsx
  // Declared as an inline object
  <Component xcss={{ color: 'var(--ds-text)' }} />;

  // Declared with the cssMap API
  const styles = cssMap({ text: { color: 'var(--ds-text)' } });
  <Component xcss={styles.text} />;
  ```

  To concatenate and conditonally apply styles use the `cssMap` and `cx` functions.

- dccb71e0: Adds third generic for XCSSProp type for declaring what properties and pseudos should be required.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 427cead: **Breaking change:** When using the `css` prop with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) you now need to declare a JSX pragma enabling types for that module. Previously when importing the `@compiled/react` package the global JSX namespace would be polluted as a side effect potentially causing collisions with other CSS-in-JS libraries. Now thanks to the use of [locally scoped JSX namespaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#locally-scoped-jsx-namespaces) the global JSX namespace will no longer be polluted.

  As an added bonus the `css` prop will only be available on JSX elements that have also defined a `className` prop with the potential for more type safe features later on.

  Make sure to update all Compiled dependencies to latest when adopting this change.

  **Automatic runtime**

  ```diff
  -import '@compiled/react';
  +/** @jsxImportSource @compiled/react */

  <div css={{ display: 'block' }} />;
  ```

  **Classic runtime**

  ```diff
  -import '@compiled/react';
  +/** @jsx jsx */
  +import { jsx } from '@compiled/react';

  <div css={{ display: 'block' }} />;
  ```

  To aid consumers in adopting this change easily, a new ESLint rule `jsx-pragma` has been created which will automatically migrate you to use a JSX pragma if missing when running with `--fix`. The rule takes an option to configure the runtime (either classic or automatic) and defaults to automatic.

  ```sh
  npm i @compiled/eslint-plugin
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "rules": {
      "@compiled/jsx-pragma": ["error", { "runtime": "classic" }]
    }
  }
  ```
