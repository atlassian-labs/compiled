Fixes two scenarios found in https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/1789

- The static syntax of `"8px ".concat("8px")` which is auto-generated by certain Babel targets generates `props.style` outputs when not necessaryâ€”we can simplify this to `"8px 8px"` ourselves.
- Mixing "indirect selectors" (eg. `~`, `+`, `|`, `||`) that do not inherit CSS variables with dynamic styles which generates CSS variables and `props.style` will never work in Compiled, this now throws an error.
